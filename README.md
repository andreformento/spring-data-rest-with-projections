## Fun

### Build and run
```
gradle bootRun
```

### API


#### Get employees
```
$ curl localhost:8080/employees
```
No security required!

#### About security
```
$ curl -X POST -d '{"firstName": "Saruman", "lastName": "the evil one", "title": "the White"}' localhost:8080/employees
```
This is not good - you need to be authenticated :sweat:

#### With security but USER level credentials :sweat_smile:
```
$ curl -X POST -d '{"firstName": "Saruman", "lastName": "the evil one", "title": "the White"}' localhost:8080/employees -u greg:turnquist
```
You are now denied due to not having sufficient authorization.

#### Now with security but ADMIN level credentials :smile:
```
$ curl -i -X POST -d '{"firstName": "Saruman", "lastName": "the evil one", "title": "the White"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:8080/employees -u ollie:gierke
```

#### Get items
```
$ curl localhost:8080/items -u greg:turnquist
```
